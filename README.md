# GitUserDetailsFinder

This simple project is created to get User Details (_name, company, location, email_) of a Git Repository. Information about **Subscribers**, **Stargazers**, those who **Forks** can be found. 

This is useful to contact users personally (informing about meetups, events, etc).

Check [wiki](https://github.com/devender-yadav/GitUserDetailsFinder/wiki) for usage of API.
